 * Dealer AI. Will choose whether or not to hit based on likelihood of going over 21. 
 * Decreases likelihood as total gets closer to 21, but still has chance to hit anyways. For example, even if at 20, can still have very, very small chance of hitting anyways for an Ace
 * Will display dealer hand once game is finished with icons and a numerical value for dealer's card.
